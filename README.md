    -   `Ctrl/Cmd + K` to focus the search bar.
    -   `1-9` to switch between categories.
-   **Performance Optimized**: Utilizes React hooks like `useMemo` for efficient filtering and `LazyMotion` to only load animations when needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Customize Your Projects**
    This is the most important step! Open `src/data/projects.js` and replace the placeholder data with your own projects. The structure is designed to be straightforward and supports multiple languages.

    ```javascript
    // src/data/projects.js

    export const projectsData = {
      "Web Development": [
        {
          id: 'project-one',
          title: {
            en: 'My First Awesome Project',
            tr: 'ƒ∞lk Harika Projem'
          },
          summary: {
            en: 'A brief summary of what this project does.',
            tr: 'Bu projenin ne yaptƒ±ƒüƒ±na dair kƒ±sa bir √∂zet.'
          },
          // ... other project details like images, tags, links
        },
      ],
      "Mobile Apps": [
        // ... more projects
      ]
    };
    ```

4.  **Run the development server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the address shown in your terminal) to view it in the browser.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (Future Features)

This project has a solid foundation, but there's always room for improvement. Here are some ideas for future development:

-   [ ] **CMS Integration**: Fetch project data from a headless CMS like Contentful, Sanity, or Strapi.
-   [ ] **Advanced Filtering**: Add functionality to filter by multiple tags simultaneously.
-   [ ] **Unit & Integration Tests**: Implement tests with Jest and React Testing Library to ensure stability.
-   [ ] **SEO Enhancements**: Use `react-helmet-async` for more granular control over meta tags for each project page.
-   [ ] **Contact Form**: Add a dedicated contact page or a modal with a functional contact form.
